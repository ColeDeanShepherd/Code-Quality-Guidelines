## Testing

* unit testing
* integration testing
* stress testing
* integration with D.B.C.

## Design By Contract

* preconditions
* postconditions
* invariants

## Overflow & Underflow

* How the hell do you handle this in reliable systems???

## malloc failures

* How the hell do you handle this in reliable systems???

## Performance

* Data-oriented design
* Bottlenecks
* Profiling
* Algorithm choice

## Commenting

* Prefer to make the code as descriptive as possible.
* Comments just add extra knowledge that you cannot convey in code.

## Version Control

* Use it!

## Global Variables

* Avoid it

## Parallelism

* Shared memory
  * Race conditions
    * Detection
    * Avoidance
* Message passing
